<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="box">
    <p>A simple 5 ingredient tomato soup made with butter, onion, and canned San Marzano tomatoes. Based on the Marcella
        Hazan tomato sauce recipe. This hits the cozy vibes just right.</p>
</div>
<p>Total time: <em>50 minutes</em></p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<div class="box">
    <ul>
        <li>two 28-ounce cans <strong>San Marzano tomatoes</strong> (whole or crushed will work – I usually use whole
            tomatoes, and we use the DeLallo brand!)</li>
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) <strong>salted butter</strong></li>
        <li>1 <strong>yellow onion</strong>, peel removed and cut into 4 chunks</li>
        <li>3–4 cloves <strong>smashed garlic</strong> (optional)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons <strong>salt</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<div class="box">
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Tomato Soup: Put the tomatoes, butter, and onion in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring it up to
            a
            low bubble, then turn the heat to medium low. Cover partially with a lid; let it simmer for 45 minutes. Stir
            every 15 minutes or so to prevent scorching on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove Onion Chunks: Remove the onion pieces using tongs. I leave the garlic in there, but that’s up to you!
        </li>
        <li>Blend the Tomato Soup: Using an immersion blender, blend up the soup until it’s a smooth as you want it.
            Taste
            and adjust; you can thin it out with milk, water, broth, cream, whatever you want; I just leave it as-is!
        </li>
        <li>Serve: Serve tomato soup with garlic bread, grilled cheese, croutons, crackers, pesto, whatever you like!
        </li>
    </ol>
