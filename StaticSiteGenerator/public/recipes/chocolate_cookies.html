<h2 class="title">Description</h2>
<div class="box">
    <p>Just two chocolate chip cookies – lightly crisp around the edge, and dense and buttery through the middle.
        They are thick enough to sink your teeth into and just really, really good.</p>
</div>
<p>Total time: <em>15 minutes</em></p>
<h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
<div class="box">
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons <strong>butter</strong>, very soft or partially melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons packed <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons <strong>white sugar</strong> </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>vanilla</strong> </li>
        <li>1 <strong>egg</strong> yolk </li>
        <li>1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons <strong>all-purpose flour</strong> (~60 grams, see note 1) </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>cornstarch</strong> </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>baking soda</strong> </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>kosher salt</strong> </li>
        <li>1/4 cup <strong>chocolate chips</strong> </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
<div class="box">
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Mix butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and egg yolk until combined. </li>
        <li>Stir in flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. When a soft dough has formed, stir in the chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the dough into two balls and place on a baking sheet – there should be plenty for two large cookies
            plus a
            little bit of dough for a snack. (You’re welcome.) You can add more chocolate chips to the top of the
            cookies if
            you want.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, depending on your oven temp and desired level of gooey cookie center. </li>
        <li>Rest the cookies for a few minutes so they settle down and solidify a bit – I set a timer for 10-15 minutes
            and
            just let them rest right on the pan. At that point they should be able to transfer to a plate, or maybe even
            held in your hand, for warm, delicious eating on the couch. Yum, yum, yum.</li>
    </ol>
