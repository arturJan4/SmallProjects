## Description

Just two chocolate chip cookies – lightly crisp around the edge, and dense and buttery through the middle.  
They are thick enough to sink your teeth into and just really, really good.

Total time: *15 minutes*

### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons **butter**, very soft or partially melted
- 3 tablespoons packed **brown sugar**
- 1 1/2 tablespoons **white sugar**
- 1/4 teaspoon **vanilla**
- 1 **egg** yolk
- 1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons **all-purpose flour** (~60 grams, see note 1)
- 1 teaspoon **cornstarch**
- 1/4 teaspoon **baking soda**
- 1/4 teaspoon **kosher salt**
- 1/4 cup **chocolate chips**

### Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mix butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and egg yolk until combined.
3. Stir in flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. When a soft dough has formed, stir in the chocolate chips.
4. Roll the dough into two balls and place on a baking sheet – there should be plenty for two large cookies plus a little bit of dough for a snack. (You’re welcome.) You can add more chocolate chips to the top of the cookies if you want.
5. Bake for 10-12 minutes, depending on your oven temp and desired level of gooey cookie center.
6. Rest the cookies for a few minutes so they settle down and solidify a bit – I set a timer for 10-15 minutes and just let them rest right on the pan. At that point they should be able to transfer to a plate, or maybe even held in your hand, for warm, delicious eating on the couch. Yum, yum, yum.
