## Description

Basic Soft Pretzels! Necessary dippers for your beer cheese soup ♡

Total time: *1 hour 15 minutes*

### Ingredients

- 1 cup warm **milk**
- 1 package **instant yeast**
- 3 tablespoons **brown sugar**
- 2 tablespoons **melted butter**
- 1 teaspoon **salt**
- 2 1/4 cups **all-purpose flour**
- more **flour** for dusting


### Steps

1. Make the Dough: In a mixing bowl, gently whisk the warm milk, yeast, brown sugar, butter, and salt. Stir in the flour until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead 10-15 times.
2. Let the Dough Hang Out: Return to the bowl and drizzle with a little oil to prevent sticking. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and set aside for an hour to rise.
3. Pretzel-ify: When the dough has risen, punch it back down and divide it into 6-8 sections. Roll each section into a loooong skinny rope. Fold it into a pretzel. Dip into the baking soda solution and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
4. Bake: Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with salt. Bake at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown. YUUUUUM! Dip in cheese sauce, mustard, or my personal favorite – beer cheese soup.
