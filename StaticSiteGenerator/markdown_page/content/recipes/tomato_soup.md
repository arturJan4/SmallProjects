## Description

Basic Soft Pretzels! Necessary dippers for your beer cheese soup ♡

Total time: *1 hour 15 minutes*

### Ingredients

- two 28-ounce cans **San Marzano tomatoes** (whole or crushed will work – I usually use whole tomatoes, and we use the DeLallo brand!)
- 1 stick (8 tablespoons) **salted butter**
- 1 **yellow onion**, peel removed and cut into 4 chunks
- 3–4 cloves **smashed garlic** (optional)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons **salt**


### Steps

1. Make the Tomato Soup: Put the tomatoes, butter, and onion in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring it up to a low bubble, then turn the heat to medium low. Cover partially with a lid; let it simmer for 45 minutes. Stir every 15 minutes or so to prevent scorching on the bottom.
2. Remove Onion Chunks: Remove the onion pieces using tongs. I leave the garlic in there, but that’s up to you!
3. Blend the Tomato Soup: Using an immersion blender, blend up the soup until it’s as smooth as you want it. Taste and adjust; you can thin it out with milk, water, broth, cream, whatever you want; I just leave it as-is!
4. Serve: Serve tomato soup with garlic bread, grilled cheese, croutons, crackers, pesto, whatever you like!
