## Game Of Life
![Example frame](./gameoflife.png)
Simple Conway's Game of Life using terminal **(colorama FTW!)** graphics
1. Infite loop to simulate a board given as a 2d array of ones and zeros directly in the code, or in the file *toad.txt*.
2. Can generate random boards of given size and simulate them.
3. Unit tested.
